# A slice takes only a portion of the List based on the one or two indexes provided.
# In this case, for the first print statement, we print index 1 to index 3 in the list. The last number is excluded.

# del removed the item with the index of 5 
# pop() takes the element specified by the index without removing it from the list. If no index is given it takes the last item in the list.

# Sort() sorts the list by grouping the items that start with the same letter
# Reverse() reverses the order of items in the list

# The loop moves through the list. x is a variable who's value is an item in the list. It's value changes each time the loop starts again until it goes through the entire list.
