TASK 2

Parameter passing is a technique used to transfer data between different parts of code.
It allows functions to be more versatile and makes the code more efficient.

To pass a parameter, you must first create a function. Here is an example form the task below:
 ex. def multiplication_table(number):
     In this function "number" is the parameter and it allows us to take an input,
     "number = int(input("Choose a number: "))"
     and then use that input in the multiplication_table function.

# TASK 3

def multiplication_table(number):
    for i in range(1, 11):
        multiplied_number = number * i
        print(f"\n{number} x {i} = {multiplied_number}")

number = int(input("Choose a number: "))
multiplication_table(number)
